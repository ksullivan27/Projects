    "You find yourself in a ramshackle one-room cottage, abandoned long ago by anyone who once entertained life's ordinary pleasures. It is dusty and forlorn yet somehow undeniably cozy. The late afternoon sunlight seeps weakly through the moth-eaten curtains, painting patterns on the worn wooden floorboards that hint of forgotten laughter and secrets whispered in the night. \n",

    "To the north, the door, barely hanging on its hinges, leads to what was once a charming garden path, now reclaimed by the unyielding grasp of nature; brambles and twisted vines run rampant, marking the passage of time that mankind forgot.\n",

    "Around you, a few relics hold out stubbornly against the annihilation of civilization. A forsaken fishing pole rests against the shadowy corner, whispering tales of tranquil days, while a vial of radiant, emerald-green liquid - a poisonous potion, no doubt concocted in the crucible of man's unquenchable thirst for dominance - is more ominous, sitting quietly on the rustic table like a ticking time bomb.\n",
