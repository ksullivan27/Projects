CIS 5300

This is my portion of the CIS 5300 NLP final project. The tennis data and project inspiration came from the following project:
- Tie-breaker: Using language models to quantify gender bias in sports journalism (2016)
- by Liye Fu, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Lillian Lee
- Cornell University
- https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/papers/gender-tennis.pdf

This project aims to analyze gender bias in tennis journalism by training language models on game commentary and comparing post-match interview question perplexities between men and women. My team decided to build on the original project's bigram model, looking at perplexity scores in trigram and LSTM models. We also ran some embedding experiments.
