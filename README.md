# NLP
CIS 5300

This is my portion of the CIS 5300 NLP final project. The tennis data and project inspiration came from the following project:
- Tie-breaker: Using language models to quantify gender bias in sports journalism (2016)
- by Liye Fu, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Lillian Lee
- Cornell University
