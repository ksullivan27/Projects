    "One way of fixing this would be to GPT to seperate the commands (e.g. by re-writing the command to include commas) before creating an ActionSequence.  So a command like \"I want to head to the garden and then go to the fishing pond. After I catch a fish with my pole then go back to the garden again.\" would get rewritten as \"I want to head to the garden, go to the fishing pond, catch a fish with my pole, go back to the garden again\"."
